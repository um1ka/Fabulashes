            <h1>Types of Eyelash Extensions</h1>
            <p>
            Lash artists use three different kinds of eyelash extension materials: mink, silk, and synthetic. Some studios also carry "faux mink" extensions, which are technically just synthetic extensions that mimic mink extensions. Most lash studios have their preference for the type of lash extension they use and won't always ask you if you have a preference. So if you're vegan or allergic to cats, be sure to specifically request that mink lash extensions are not used on you. No lash extension type lasts longer than the other, but mink and silk lashes tend to have a more natural look, while synthetic lashes can be thicker and darker, which is better suited for those who want a bolder look.
            Within these three categories (mink, silk, and synthetic), there are varying degrees of length and curl to choose from. Typically your lash artist will use multiple lengths and curl strengths to create a wide-eyed effect, with longer lashes being placed towards the outer corners of the eyes and shorter lashes placed on the inner corners.
